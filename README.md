# dApp Starter

> The template I use to kickstart all my web3 apps.

This starter kit is composed of Next.js and Tailwind CSS, with ConnectKit, viem, & wagmi for all your web3 needs. It uses Typescript and an opinionated directory structure for maximum dev confy-ness.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies with `yarn install`. Then, initialize the env file with `cp .env.example .env`, and add your Infura project id. Finally, run the development server with `yarn dev`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
